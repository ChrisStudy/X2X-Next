## Overview

This project is my ongoing **Next.js personal website**, used to experiment with modern frontend patterns while serving as a real-world portfolio.

It combines **static content** (projects, pages) with **dynamic data** such as live weather information, demonstrating how to balance performance and real-time updates in a production-ready setup.

## Key Features

- Project pages generated from Markdown files
- Static Site Generation with incremental revalidation
- Weather data fetched via external API
- Modular component structure for layouts and UI
- Mobile-first, responsive design

## Tech Stack

The site is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, leveraging **getStaticProps** for static generation and **ISR** for periodic updates.  
Styling is handled with **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite**, while project content is managed through **Markdown**, allowing easy updates without touching application logic.
